# Welcome! {-}
At the Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics we have been running a program to turn telematics data into information about the road freight industry in Australia. Now that the code for our project is public we're providing this document to talk about some of the problems we've faced and decisions we've made. We call this process [Yulo](https://github.com/BITRE-Telematics/Yulo). There are many more things that aren't in here, but we hope it will help those who use our results, and those who use our code. We've tried to make it readable and accessible. But first, why telematics?
