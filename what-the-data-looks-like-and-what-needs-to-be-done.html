<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> What the data looks like and what needs to be done</h1>
<p>We get data in a bunch of formats, including xml, json and csv but when it comes down to it telematics data is just a long list of observation. Each device pings every so often reporting “I am here at this time.” A longitude, a latitude, a time and an id. That’s it. Sometimes we might get some other things like a speedometer reading or even a direction (with we call an azimuth) but not usually. Turning this long list of pings into information about the freight network is not obvious.
But first, lets just have a closer look at these pings and we notice some stuff that is funny even before we start.
## GPS error
MELBOURNE MAP
Here is the South Bank of Melbourne, and each dot is an observation. It’s pretty obvious that most are on the motorway. But some are on the shoulder, some even in the wall and some inside buildings. This clearly isn’t right, but GPS measurement error is a fact of life. Most of the time it is fine, but sometimes we need to account for the truck that says it is in a building when it is on the road.</p>
<div id="repeated-observations" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Repeated observations</h2>
<p>When we first looked at the data we’d occasionally note trucks that just…stopped. It wasn’t just that they were in the same place, they were in <strong>exactly</strong> the same place. A truck that has stopped usually looks like it is moving around just a little bit because of GPS error but these were in the same place for minutes on end, to 5-6 decimal places. More over they were doing this in the middle of the road, which didn’t seem to be likely. In particular we noted them stopping here, on the M5 Motorway in Sydney. If you know Sydney you might start guessing what has happened. This is the entrance to a tunnel. GPS devices work by listening to satellites constantly shouting out where they are, but in a tunnel those satellites cannot be heard, so the GPS devices didn’t know where they were. Unable to create a correct location, sometimes they would gave a error but other times they would just report the last place they were sure they had been, at the mouth of the tunnel. Subsequently, after a good time, apparently loitering at the entrance of the tunnel they would abruptly appear at the exit. Whatever we did would need to account for what happened in the tunnel even if the GPS couldn’t tell us directly.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Weirder errors</h2>
<p>YELLOW MAPS
Lastly, have a look at this group of traces (observations linked together in order) in Brisbane. It’s very easy to see the outlines of motorways and other main roads, but something is definitely off. I think it is reasonable to suspect vehicles did not teleport, or fly or otherwise travel from Brisbane into the bush or Moreton Bay and back in minutes. For whatever reason this firm, although most of its data was fine, occasionally threw in complete bogies which we would need to account for.</p>
